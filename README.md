Hello! This repository contains the code, data, and saved MCMC chains for reproducing the figures and calculations in the paper "Testing time-delayed cosmology" (to appear soon on arXiv). Please note that you will need to install the SOAD, ddeint, PyMultiNest, corner.py, and GetDist Python packages to run the code.
